# Molecular Biology
The codes for analyzing the molecular biology data and to plot the results have been placed in this repository. Separate folders have been created for each analysis. Each of these folders contains the script and associated data files. The premise for each analysis has been explained at the beginning of each script. The repository now contains the following:
1. Bayesian Phylogeographic and Ecological Clustering (bpec)
2. Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components (dapc)
3. Nonlinear relationship between genetic differentiation and geographic distances [isolation by distance, environment and resistance] (gdm)
4. Standardized measure of genetic differentiation (gen.diversity)
5. Analysis of genetic structure using *Geneland* (geneland)
6. Phylogenetic tree and analysis of phylogenetic signals for plant traits (phylo)
7. Plotting genetic structure (pophelper)
